This project aims at producing a filter produces an output in such a way that it maximizes the ratio of output peak power to mean noise power in its frequency response using MATLAB software. The matched filter is designed as an optimal linear filter for maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the presence of noise which is analyzed using MATLAB.
